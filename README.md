# Nand2Tetris
Personal project following www.nand2tetris.org using (1) (Begun April 2019)

## Assignment 1

(Completed 4/7/2019)

Project to create basic boolean gates, multiplexers, and demultiplexers starting from a Nand gate.  Completed using VHDL rather than the HDL created by the authors.  This was done as a way to learn basic VHDL.  Each gate has a testbench in addition to it's entity file.  


## Assignment 2

(Completed 5/14/2019)

Project building off of assignment 1 to build additional combinational circuits.  Culminating in the creation of an ALU based on the specification defined in (1).  Circuits were once again defined in VHDL and created with testbenches.  

## Assignment 3

(Completed 8/11/2019)

Project creating sequential circuits through structural modeling using a D flip flop as the base unit and combinational circuits created in the previous assignments.  Circuits described in VHDL based on the specification ins (1).
