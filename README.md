# Nand2Tetris
Personal project following www.nand2tetris.org using mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-computing-systems (Begun April 2019)

## Assignment 1

(Completed 4/7/2019)

Project to create basic boolean gates, multiplexers, and demultiplexers starting from Nand.  Completed using VHDL rather than the HDL created by the authors.  This was done as a way to learn VHDL as it is a standard.  Each gate has a testbench in addition to it's entity file.
